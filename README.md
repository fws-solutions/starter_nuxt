## Working with Components

### Creating Files

There are four types of template views:
- Blocks
- Main
- Parts

To create a new Vue component, execute `fws creates files` command and pass `--block` or `--part` with an argument.

    fws create-file component-name --block
    fws create-file part-name --part

Alternatively, it is possible and **recommended** to use short aliases.

    fws cf component-name -b
    fws cf part-name -p

Note that in this case the option argument is passed with one '-' instead of two '--'.

This command will create new module file in appropriate directory `components/blocks` or `components/parts`:
* .vue

#### Naming Conventions

Naming convention for Vue files should be as follows:
- each component should be named using PascalCase format,
- each block component should have a prefix 'Block',
- each part component should have a prefix 'Part'.

It is essential to keep in mind these rules when creating the files manually.

When using `create-file` or `cf` command, these rules will be applied automatically.

    Example:
    fws create-file team --block

    or short:
    fws cf team -b

    Will create:
    components/blocks/BlockTeam.vue

### SVG Icons

To generate SVG icons, execute `fws icons` task.

    fws icons

This command will optimize all SVG files in `assets/svg` directory.

Import SvgIcon.vue file like any other component from `components/base/SvgIcon/SvgIcon.vue`.

Use component as shown in this example:

 `<SvgIcon class="banner__caption-icon" iconName="ico-dog"/>`.

The attribute `iconName` is required, pass the name of the svg file from `assets/svg`.

Additionally you can set any other standard HTML attributes, like `class`.

    Example:
    <SvgIcon class="banner__caption-icon" iconName="ico-dog"/>

    Will render:
    <span class="banner__caption-icon svg-icon">
        <svg>...</svg>
    </span>

## Media

Any media files that will be static should be placed in **static** directory.

Any media files that are used in frontend phase only should be placed in **__demo** folder with **subfolders** for each page inside **static** directory.

Any image should not be larger then 2300px in width, unless thereâ€™s a special need for it. Starter Theme comes with predefined image size 'max-width', which **should always** be used for this purpose.

    add_image_size('max-width', 2300, 9999, false);

All image sizes **should** be delared in `fws/src/Images.php` file.

## SCSS
All Components styles should be written in corresponding `.vue` file.

All Vue Components styles should be written in `.vue` files.

All global styles should be written in `assets/css` directories.
